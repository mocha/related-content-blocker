=======================

A filter for Adblock that is designed to knock out (un)related content advertisements.

## Usage

1. Use Chrome.
2. Install [Adblock](https://adblockplus.org/en/chrome)
3. In the Adblock options, under "Custom Filter Lists", add this very long url: *http://e0a94a2909382aaa3ec1-24ef4fae91757aa3c51f6506fde75c73.r51.cf1.rackcdn.com/relatedcontent.txt*
4. Relax.

## Contributions

I would love to have your contributions! Please send me a pull request if you've spotted something I've missed (which I'm sure you have, because there's not much in there yet,) and I'll get it in there and the CDN updated right away.
